#   JAVA 

## Programming Language
The language which is used to write a program is known as programming language.
- The Java programme which we write is known as **Source Code** or **Java file**
- Our system doesn't understand java programme.
- To overcome this problem java has provided us with the following 2 Software.

1. Compiler
2. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

- Compiler checks the syntax of Java Programme and then generates **Byte-Code** and converts it into <u>machine level language</u>.

# IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
**It is a platform where programms are written and executed.**
