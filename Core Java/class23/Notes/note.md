# Var - Arg method or Variable Argument Method 
Accorting to the Var - Arg concept we can input multiple number of value within a single variable inside the argument part of any method. 

Problem:
 m1(int x, int y , int z){

 }

 We can achieve the var-arg concept by the help of triple dot. 
 m1(int... x){
System.out.println("var-arg");

 }

 public static void main

 -> It is not applicable for any-normal variable concept, it is only applicable for those variable which is declared inside the argument part of any method.
-> Not less than two 

-> The var-arg concept is otherwise acts as 1D Array
