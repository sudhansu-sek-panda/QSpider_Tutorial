# Method Overloading
**Creating multiple methods with same method name and different type of argument inside a single class is the concept of method loading.** 

**A**
<pre> 
m1(int x);
m1(int y);
</pre>
No

**B**
<pre>
m1(int x);
m2(float y);
</pre>
NO

**C**
m1(int x);
m1(float y);
m1(char z);
**Yes**


**Q.** How could we use method overloading in different classes **?**

Method overloading happens in same class at the end even we have declared the same method in different class.

Is method overloading only applicable for user defind classes or it is applicable for system classes also?
