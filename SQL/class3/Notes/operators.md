# Operators


Operators are the special symbol which is used to perform the specific operation.
- In SQL are classified into **7** types
1. Arithmetic Operator
2. Concatenation Operator
3. Relational Operator
4. Logical Operator
5. Comparision Operator
6. Special Operator
7. Sub-Query Operator

### Arithmetic Operator
*  **Addition Operator (+)**  
It is an operator which is used to _find the sum of 2 or more operands_.
* **Substraction Operator (-)**  
It is an operator which is used to _find the difference between two or more operands_.
* **Multiplication Operator (*)**  
It is an operator which is used to find the product of two or more operands.
* **Division Operator (/)**  
It is an operator which is used to get the exact division output of the given operands.
### Concatenation Operator
It is an operator which is used to find or merge two or more collections.

### Relational Operator
* **Relational Greater than Operator (>)**
It is an operator which is used to check whether the operand one is greater than the operand two or not.    

It will return the result as true, if operand one is greater than operand two, else it return the result as false.

* **Relational Less than Operator (<)**

It is an operator which is used to check whether the operand one is less than the operand two or not.

It will return the result as **true**, if _operand one is less than operand two_, else it returns the result as **false**.

* **Relational Greater than Equals Operator (>=)**  
It is an operator which is used to check whether operand one is greater than opernad two or operand one is exactly same as operand two or not.

It will return the result as true, if operand one is greater than operand two or operand one is same as operand two.

* 
**Relational Less than Equals Operator (<=)**
It is an operator which is used to check whether operand one is less than opernad two or operand one is exactly same as operand two or not.

It will return the result as true, if operand one is less than operand two or operand one is same as operand two.

### Logical Operators
Logical operators are used whenever we have to deal with multiple conditions.

* **Logical And Operator**  
It is an operator which will result the return as true if all the given conditions returns the result as true, else it will return the result as false.

* **Logical OR Operators**

It is an operator which will result the return as true if any one of the given condition returns the result as true, else the result as false.
* **Logical NOT Operator**

### Special Operators
* **IN Operator**
* **NOT IN Operator**
* **BETWEEN Operator**


Syntax: <br/> **Operand one BETWEEN Lower_range AND Upper_range**
