Function which is used to store a set of instruction into it.
With the help of function we can increase the efficiency of a programme by reducing the number of instructions.
-> In SQL there are two types of functions are there. THey are: -
1 - Single Rows Functions
2 - Multi Row Functions

Multi Row Functions
================================
-> It is a function which accepts n number of records as an input and returns a single record as an resultant.
-> It takes all the inputs at one short and then executes and provides a single output.

List of multi row functions
==================================
MAX() - It is used to obtain the maximum value present in the column.
MIN() - It is used to obtain the minimum value present in the column.
AVG() - It is used to obtain the average of values present in the column.
COUNT() - It is used to obtain the number of values present in the column.
SUM() - It is used to obtain the sumation of the values present in the column.

Notes:
-> Multi Row functions are the functions which accepts only one argument i.e column name or expression.
-> In select clause we are not supposed to use any another column name along with multi row function.
-> Multi row functions will ignore the null values.
-> Count is the only function which accepts * as an argument.
-> We can't use multi row functions in where clause.

WAQTD THE MAXIMUM SALARY GIVEN IN EACH DEPARTMENT

SELECT MAX(SAL) 
FROM EMP 
WHERE DEPTNO IN (10,20,30,40);


GROUP BY - Clause
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
-> Group By clause is used to group the records. 
Syntax:
SELECT group function/ group by expression
FROM table name
[WHERE] <filter row>
GROUP column name/ expression;

Order of execution
`````````````````````````````
1 - FROM
2 - WHERE
3 - GROUP BY
4 - SELECT

WHERE - ROW BY ROW
GROUP - ROW BY ROW
SELECT - GROUP BY GROUP

NOTE:

-> Group by clause is used to group the records.
-> Group By clause will execute row by row.
-> After the execution of group by clause we get the groups.
-> Before any clause that executes after group by must execute group by group.
-> The column name or the expressison used for grouping can be used in select clause.
-> Group By clause can be used without a where clause. 


Example: 




HAVING CLAUSE: It is used to filter the groups.
Syntax:
-> SELECT
-> FROM
-> WHERE
-> GROUP BY
-> HAVING <GROUP filter condition>
