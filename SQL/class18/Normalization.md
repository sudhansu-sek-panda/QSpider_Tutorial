# Normalization

It is a process of converting a large table into smaller table inorder to remove redundancy and anomalies by identifying their functional dependency is known as Normalization.


### Normal Form
Any Table which doesn't have redundancies and anomalies is said to be in Normal Form.


### Levels of Normal Form

- 1<sup>st</sup> NF
- 2<sup> nd</sup> NF
- 3<sup> rd  </sup> NF
- BCNF 
- 4<sup>th</sup> NF


### 1st Normal Form
- Table shouldn't have duplicate records in it.
- The table shouldn't have multivalued data.
### 2nd Normal Form
- The table should be in 1st Normal FOrM
- Table shouldnot have partial functional dependency

### 3rd Normal Form
- Table should be in 2nd Normal Form
- Table should not have transitive functional dependency.


### BCNF (Boyce - Codd Normal Form)

- Table should be in 3rd Normal Form.
- Each and every attribute of a table should be determined as a candidate key.

### 4NF
 Multivalued Dependencies should be there to increase the efficiency of a table.
